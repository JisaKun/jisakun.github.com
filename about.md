### About Me

Currently, I am a senior student at [NUAA](http://nuaa.edu.cn/nuaanew/), China. I am going to study at [UCSD](http://www.ucsd.edu) on Sept. I do have some SNS, but I rarely use them. The best way to contact me is email.


### About this Blog

This is the base Jekyll theme. 

This Blog is powered by Jekyll, Github and Markdown. I am not so familiar with this stuff now. But I will make it better and better. :)

The theme of this blog:

1. Simple, as simple as possible, Keep it Simple Stupid(Kiss)
2. original, everything posted must be original

to be continued...


目的：

1. 锻炼自己的写作能力
2. 记录学习过程，“教”是最好的“学”
3. 书写是为了更好的思考
4. 总结反省
5. 锻炼自己的意志，学会持之以恒地做一件事
